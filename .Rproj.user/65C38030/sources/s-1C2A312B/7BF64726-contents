## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
Sys.setlocale(category = "LC_ALL", locale = "cht")
```
```{r}
Sys.setlocale(category = "LC_ALL", locale = "English")
```

```{r}
char1 <- c("Wild","Apple","Donald","May","Avocada") 
factor1 <- factor(char1)
levels(factor1)
```
```{r}
library(stringr)
char2 <- c("蔡英文","習近平","Donald Trump","蔡頭") 
factor2 <- factor(char2)
levels(factor2)

sort(
  str_sub(char2,1,1)
)
sort(
  str_sub(char2,2,2)
)
```
```{r}
Sys.getlocale("LC_COLLATE")
```
